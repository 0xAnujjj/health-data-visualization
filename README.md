## Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive visual analysis of a health dataset using Python. The goal is to explore trends, distributions, and relationships among key health indicators including:

- **Age**
- **Heart Rate**
- **Sex**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Heart Condition**

## Visualizations & Insights

### 1️⃣ Trend of Heart Rate across Age Groups

![Line Chart](plots/lineChart.png)

**Insight:**  
This line chart shows the average heart rate for different age groups. The heart rate values fluctuate slightly, indicating no significant change across age ranges in the dataset.

---

### 2️⃣ BMI Ranges across Age Groups

![Bar Plot](plots/barPlot.png)

**Insight:**  
This bar chart displays the count of individuals in different BMI ranges for each age group. Most individuals fall within the **25–30** and **30–40** BMI categories, suggesting a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity across all age groups.

---

### 3️⃣ Heart Condition Proportion

![Pie Chart](plots/pieChart.png)

**Insight:**  
The pie chart shows the proportion of individuals with and without heart conditions. Although a slightly larger portion has no heart condition, the distribution is relatively balanced.

---

### 4️⃣ Variation in Systolic Blood Pressure

![Box Plot](plots/boxPlot.png)

**Insight:**  
This box plot represents the distribution of systolic blood pressure values. The median lies near the center, and the spread indicates moderate variation without extreme outliers.

---

### 5️⃣ Relationship between BMI and Systolic Blood Pressure

![Scatter Plot](plots/scatterPlot.png)

**Insight:**  
A scatter plot using a random sample of the dataset was chosen to reduce overcrowding and improve clarity. The points are widely scattered, indicating **no strong correlation** between BMI and systolic blood pressure in this dataset.

---

### 6️⃣ Distribution of Body Mass Index

![Histogram](plots/histogram.png)

**Insight:**
This histogram shows the distribution of Body Mass Index (BMI) values in the dataset. Most individuals fall within the normal to overweight BMI range, while fewer individuals are observed in the underweight and obese categories. This indicates that the dataset mainly represents individuals with moderate BMI levels.
